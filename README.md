![IMG_20251109_135036_049](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83cc9acc-308c-4d2f-871e-4d263e6751e8)

**Plastikva** is a hopeful, atmospheric 2.5D adventure game where you play as a sentient plastic fish on a quest for biological transformation. Born on a store shelf and discarded into the sea, you must navigate the world’s most polluted waters to prove you are more than just "trash."
Through acts of environmental stewardship and symbiotic growth, Plastikva evolves from a brittle synthetic object into a living part of the ocean’s ecosystem.

## Core Features:
🔄 The Gameplay Loop
Rescue: Free marine life from "ghost" nets and plastic rings to build Reputation.
Restore: Collect and sort waste (Biodegradable vs. Non-biodegradable) to decontaminate the level.

🤝 Reputation & Social UI
Your relationship with the ocean is tracked via a dynamic meter:

Shunned ➔ Wary ➔ Neutral ➔ Trusted ➔ Friend
Higher reputation levels don't just change dialogue; they unlock Allies who provide safe passage through currents or help you lift heavy debris.

**Plastikva is a reminder that the damage done to our oceans isn't irreversible. It celebrates the power of small actions and the possibility of "becoming alive" through care for our environment.**
